#Description
An app that generates either Lorem Ipsum text or random users based on the specifications of the user. 
Options for hipster text in the lorem ipsum generator and extra user information in the random user generator.

#Details for teaching team
Used Badcow/Lorem and fzainnotto/faker from packagist.
Used Hipster Ipsum code from Seth Lilly.

I know that the code is messy in randusr.blade.php when generating the password, but I couldn't figure out how to return a string from the object (which I have deleted from the models directory).

I created a custom 404 page since my links aren't working on the live site.
